	<description>Adds the trait "Free Love!" which when given to a pawn disables negative thoughtdefs that prevent vanilla polyamory.
	
	A simple XML mod and harmony patch implementing a trait that simulates 'relationship anarchy' or other forms of polyamory. This simple implementation is compatible with Polyamory Beds, Individuality, SafeJobWorld, and other mods affecting relationships. 
	
	This patch allows polyamorous relationships and disables most negative thoughtdefs without requirng you to install Rational Romance 2 or Psychology. It's probably not compatible with either of those mods. If you manually sort your load order then load it where you load other trait mods, but it probably doesn't really matter.	</description>
