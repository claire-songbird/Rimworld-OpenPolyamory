## What is this?
A simple XML mod and harmony patch implementing a trait that simulates 'relationship anarchy' or other forms of polyamory. This simple implementation is compatible with Polyamory Beds, Individuality, SafeJobWorld, and other mods affecting relationships. Should be compatible with almost everything.

## What does it do?
This patch allows polyamorous relationships and disables most negative thoughtdefs (specifically: CheatedOnMe, CheatedOnMeMood, Affair, WantToSleepWithSpouseOrLover, and SharedBed) without requirng you to install Rational Romance 2 or Psychology. It's probably not compatible with either of those mods. If you manually sort your load order then load it where you load other trait mods, but it probably doesn't really matter.	

## Where do I report bugs?
*Nowhere*. \*Tumbleweeds\*

## Is this compatible with...
I dunno. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Try it and let me know.
